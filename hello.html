			    <p>An opening on a planet's or moon's

			    produces an eruption when this material exits. 
			    Unusual amounts of material may be launched into

			</div>
			<div class="introduction-text">
			    <p>When material from a planet's or moon's 
				interior erupts onto the surface of the object 
				from its inside, a volcano is created. On 
				Earth, the erupted material can be gas, 
				cinders, ash, or liquid rock (referred to as 
				"lava" when it is on the surface and "magma" 
				when it is underground). There are three 
				potential causes for magma to ascend and 
				explode onto the surface of the Earth.
                Because of how hot it is deep below the Earth, 
				some rocks slowly melt and turn into lava, a 
				viscous fluid. Since magma is lighter than the 
				surrounding solid rock, it rises and gathers 
				in magma chambers. Some of the magma eventually 
				surges through fissures and vents to the Earth's 
				surface.</p>

    <p>WHAT TO DO</p>
    <h1>Before, During, and After</h1>

				    <h4><B>BEFORE</B></h4>
					<small>Things to do <U>BEFORE</U> a volcanic eruption:</small>
				</div>
			</div>
		    <p>1. <B>Prepare your go bag.</B></p>
			<br>
			<p>Your go bag should contain 
			flashlight and extra batteries, first aid kit and manual, 
			emergency food and water, essential medicines, respiratory 
			(breathing) protection, eye protection (goggles), and 
			battery-powered radio.</p>
			<br>
            <p>2. <B>Know the evacuation routes.</B></p>
			<br>
			<p>Avoid the volcano's downwind and downstream river valleys. The 
			wind and gravity will carry debris and ash. If you have enough 
			supplies, take temporary refuge from volcanic ash where you are.</p>
			<br>
            <p>3. <B>Charge your devices and gas up your car.</B></p>
			<br>
			<p>When a volcanic eruption occurs, fuel up your car and charge your 
			electronics to be ready. Communication during natural 
			disasters may be very helpful, as can mobility if you 
			need to get to a safe spot quickly.</p>
			<br>
            <p>4. <B>Stay indoors.</B></p>
			<br>
			<p>Stay inside since volcanic ash poses a health risk, especially 
			if you suffer from a respiratory condition like asthma or 
			bronchitis. Close all windows and doors when inside to prevent volcanic ash from 
			entering. Place wet towels at doorways. Avoid clogging up 
			phone lines with unnecessary calls.</p>
			<br>
            <p>5. <B>Be updated to local news and alert warnings.</B></p>
			<br>
            <p>Keep up with local news on volcanic eruptions to determine 
			whether you should evacuate or what to do when one occurs. 
			Pay attention to alert warnings if they are issued because 
			they may serve as a guide for you during eruptions.</p>

				    <h4><B>DURING</B></h4>
					<small>Things to do <U>DURING</U> a volcanic eruption:</small>
				</div>
			</div>
		    <p>1. <B>Evacuate or shelter somewhere safe.</B></p>
			<br>
			<p>In times of volcanic eruption, it is a must that we are 
			in a safer place rather than going anywhere.</p>
			<br>
            <p>2. <B>Too much ash fall: do NOT drive.</B></p>
			<br>
			<p>When there is too much ash falling, avoid driving to keep us 
			safe on the road.</p>
			<br>
            <p>3. <B>Wearing masks and goggles are needed.</B></p>
			<br>
			<p>As the ash fall is happening when a volcanic eruption occurs, 
			wearing a mask and goggles are needed so that we are prone to 
			having serious sickness.</p>
			<br>
            <p>4. <B>Assist children, pregnant women, & elders.</B></p>
			<br>
			<p>The children, pregnant women, elders– as well as PWDs are the 
			ones who are the priorities in case of volcanic eruptions.</p>
			<br>
            <p>5. <B>Stay away from rivers and streams</B><p>
			<br>
            <p>As much as possible, we should avoid going to rivers and 
			streams as volcanoes can blast lava and other elements coming 
			out from the volcano.</p>

				<div class="user-info">
				    <h4><B>AFTER</B></h4>
					<small>Things to do <U>AFTER</U> a volcanic eruption</small>
				</div>
			</div>
		    <p>1. <B>Check yourself and your family.</B></p>
			<br>
			<p>After the earthquake, check yourself and your family for any 
			injuries or bruises. Make sure to be ready for possible 
			aftershocks.</p>
			<br>
            <p>2. <B>Stay indoors until further announcements.</B></p>
			<br>
			<p>Stay indoors and wait for the announcement of the local 
			government to ensure the safety of the people, animals, and 
			properties.</p>
			<br>
            <p>3. <B>Check the damage it caused to your house.</B></p>
			<br>
			<p>Damage is prone to occur during volcanic eruptions. After 
			ensuring the safety of you and your family, check the well-being 
			of your house in every corner.</p>
			<br>
            <p>4. <B>Wear a mask when cleaning.</B></p>
			<br>
			<p>Volcanic eruptions produce ash. The most common and widespread 
			volcanic hazard is ash fall. Cleaning the ash left by the 
			phenomenon is essential.</p>
			<br>
            <p>5. <B>Remove ashes from your roof to prevent collapse.</B></p>
			<br>
            <p>Ash falls’ weight may differ and vary, its chemical form may a
			ffect one’s building structure. To prevent further damage, 
			remove ashes immediately as soon as possible. </p>

			    <p>Even while it might seem safe to wait out an eruption
